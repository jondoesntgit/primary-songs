title:I Keep Falling in Love With Him
key:E
I keep falling in love with Him
Over and over and over and over again.
I keep falling in love with Him
Over and over and over and over again
He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by.
Oh, what a love between my Lord and I.
I keep falling in love with Him
Over and over and over and over again
