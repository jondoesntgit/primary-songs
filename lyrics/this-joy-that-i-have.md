title:￼This Joy that I have
This joy that I have, the world didn't it give to me
this joy I have, the world didn't give to me
this joy I have, the world didn't give it to me
the world didn't give it, and the world can't take it away

1. This peace that I have... This love that I have...
2. Glory, glory, hallelujah, since I laid my burdens down..
3. Now I’m feeling so much better since I laid my burdens down...
4. Friends don’t treat me, like they used to, since I laid my burdens down...
