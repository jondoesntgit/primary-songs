title:ï¿¼Give Me Oil In My Lamp
Give me oil in my lamp, keep it burning
Give me oil in my lamp I pray
Give me oil in my lamp, keep it burning.
Keep it burning till the break of day

>Sing Hosannah, Sing Hosannah 
Sing Hosannah to the King of Kings
Sing Hosannah, Sing Hosannah
Sing Hosannah to the King!

Make me fishers of men keep me seeking,
Make me fishers of men I pray
Make me fishers of men keep me seeking,
Seeking souls until the break of day.
