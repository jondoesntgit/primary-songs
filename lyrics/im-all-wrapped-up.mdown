title:￼I’m All Wrapped Up
I'm all wrapped up, I'm all tied up. I'm all tangled up in Jesus. 
I'm all wrapped up, I'm all tied up. I'm all tangled up in God.
I'm all wrapped up, I'm all tied up. I'm all tangled up in Jesus.
I'm all wrapped up, tied up, tangled up in God.

Well, I’m inside and I’m outside And I’m side by side with Jesus...
Well I’m alright and I’m upright And I’m living right with Jesus...
