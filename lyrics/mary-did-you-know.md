title:Mary Did You Know?
key:Am

Mary did you know that your baby boy
Will one day walk on water?
Mary did you know that your baby boy
Will save our sons and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy Am Dm
Has come to make you new?
This Child that you delivered
Will soon deliver you.

Mary did you know that your baby boy
Will give sight to a blind man?
Mary did you know that your baby boy 
Will calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know your baby boy
Has walked where angles trod?
When you kiss your little baby
You kiss the face of God.

---

> The blind will see, the deaf will hear,
And the dead will live again.
The lame will leap and the dumb will speak
The praises of the praises of the Lamb.

---

Mary did you know that your baby boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary did you know that your baby boy
Will one day rule the nations?
Did you know that your baby boy
Is heavens perfect Lamb?
This sleeping child youâ€™re holding
Is the Great I Am.
