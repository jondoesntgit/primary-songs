title:Jesus Lifted Me

I'm so glad Jesus lifted me, 
I'm so glad Jesus lifted me. 
I'm so glad Jesus lifted me, 
singing glory hallelujah, 
Singing glory hallelujah, 
singing glory hallelujah, 
Jesus lifted me.

One, two, three, Satan's after me;
Four, five, six, he's chasing me with sticks;
Seven, eight, nine, he misses every time...
